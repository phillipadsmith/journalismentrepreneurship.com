## Journalism Entrepreneurship Workshops & Intensives

Several times a year, I also run business model focused workshops to grow the next generation of journalism entrepreneurs.

Drawing inspiration from the Lean Startup movement, I produce workshops that teach effective ideation and business model validation through customer interviews and small experiments that can be done in a weekend.

In a nutshell: you arrive with passion and leave with a well-tested business model, a pitch deck, and a roadmap of where to go next.

##### Testimonials

> “One of the most diverse and exciting events on the future of local journalism that I’ve ever seen.” --Burt Herman, Director of Innovation, Lenfest Institute

> “I’ve never been in a session that addressed journalism and business equally.” --Bobbi Booker, Technology & Culture Columnist, Philadelphia Tribune

> “If workshops like this had taken place 20 years ago, we wouldn’t be where we are today.” --Merrill Brown, Founder, The News Project

> “My only feedback is that I wish I had committed to staying on for both days!” --Sam Goertler, Lead Product Manager, theSkimm

##### In a workshop, you’ll learn how to:
* Describe your business idea in a way that uncovers hidden assumptions
* Design small experiments that will test those assumptions
* Prototype your idea quickly
* Conduct customer interviews, surveys, and polls
* Create a compelling story about your idea’s place in the market
* Pitch your idea clearly and passionately

##### What’s unique
* Each of the workshops I produce include expert coaching from other experienced journalism entrepreneurs. Typically the ratio of participants to coaches is five-to-one, ensuring that there’s always a coach ready to talk through your ideas.
* The workshop curriculum is also designed to provide just the right amount of encouragement and mentoring needed for your to start the process of talking to real customers about their information needs.
* Unlike other workshops, participants spend most of the weekend actively working on project teams (versus passively listening to speakers). This approach keeps energy high, and learnings memorable.
