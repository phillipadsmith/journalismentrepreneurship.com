## Journalism Entrepreneurship Coaching

I regularly provide “on demand” and “just-in-time” support for journalism entrepreneurs who are preparing for a product launch, or significant audience growth.

For more than a decade, I’ve been coaching journalists who are working to create innovative new products, platforms, and properties.

My coaching draws from 20 years of experience working with online publishers and digital-first newsrooms, as a software developer, data journalism trainer, product manager, and chief technology officer. 

To further my understanding of the Lean Startup methods and how they can be applied to journalism, I spent a year at Stanford digging into how entrepreneurship is taught by people like Steve Blank. I also invested countless hours into shadow coaching a wide range of startups with creator of the Lean Canvas, Ash Maurya. I am now a certified Lean Stack coach.
